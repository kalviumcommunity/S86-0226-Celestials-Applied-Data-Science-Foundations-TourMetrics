    "## Purpose of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to showcase how Markdown transforms notebooks from messy scratchpads into **professional, review-ready artifacts**. This notebook covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing headings to structure notebooks logically\n",
    "- Creating ordered and unordered lists for clarity\n",
    "- Using inline code and code blocks for explanation\n",
    "- Combining Markdown and code cells to tell a clear data story\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why This Matters:** Well-documented notebooks improve collaboration, reproducibility, and professionalism. Markdown is the narration of your analysis."

    "\n",
    "Headings organize notebooks into logical sections, making them easy to navigate and understand. Use the `#` symbol to create headings—more `#` symbols mean lower hierarchy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use H1 (`#`) for the notebook title**\n",
    "- **Use H2 (`##`) for major sections**\n",
    "- **Use H3 (`###`) for subsections**\n",
    "- Avoid skipping hierarchy levels (e.g., don't jump from H1 to H3)\n",
    "- Keep headings concise and descriptive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Heading Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Create date features\n",
    "  - Encode categorical variables\n",

    "### Ordered Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Use numbers when sequence matters:\n",
