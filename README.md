- Combine text and code to tell a clear data story

By completing this milestone, you will be able to:

- Structure notebooks using meaningful headings
- Document steps and assumptions using Markdown text
- Use lists to explain workflows and results
- Format code snippets inside Markdown cells
- Create notebooks that are readable and review-friendly

### 🎯 Why This Matters

Common notebook issues include:

- Notebooks that are hard to follow or review
- No explanation of what the code is doing
- Results shown without context or interpretation
- Confusing execution flow with no structure

These issues are not technical failures—they are **communication failures**.

This milestone ensures that:

- Your reasoning is clearly documented
- Reviewers can understand your approach
- Teammates can follow and reuse your work
- Your notebooks look professional and intentional

**Think of Markdown as the narration of your analysis—this lesson teaches you how to write that narration clearly.**

This is a **documentation and communication milestone**, not a data analysis task.

You are expected to:

- Create Markdown cells alongside code cells
- Practice formatting text using Markdown syntax
- Focus on clarity and structure, not complex analysis
- Use simple examples to demonstrate formatting

**No datasets or advanced computations are required.**

### 1️⃣ Writing Headings in Markdown

Use headings to organize notebook sections.

You should:

- Create top-level headings for major sections
- Use subheadings to break content into steps
- Maintain a logical, readable hierarchy
- Avoid overly long or vague headings

**This helps readers understand the notebook flow instantly.**

**Example:**
```markdown
# Main Notebook Title
## Section 1: Data Loading
### Step 1.1: Import Libraries
### Step 1.2: Load Dataset
## Section 2: Data Exploration
```

### 2️⃣ Creating Lists for Structured Explanations

Use lists to explain steps, assumptions, or results.

You should:

- Write unordered lists for general points
- Write ordered lists for step-by-step processes
- Keep list items concise and meaningful
- Use lists where structure improves readability

**Lists make explanations easier to scan and understand.**

**Example:**
```markdown
**Key Assumptions:**
- Data is collected monthly
- Missing values represent zero visitors
- All dates are in YYYY-MM format

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Load the dataset
2. Clean missing values
3. Calculate summary statistics
4. Create visualizations
```

### 3️⃣ Writing Inline Code and Code Blocks

Use code formatting inside Markdown to explain syntax.

You should:

- Use inline code for variable names or functions
- Use fenced code blocks for longer snippets
- Ensure code blocks are readable and relevant
- Avoid duplicating executable code unnecessarily

**This allows you to explain code without executing it.**

**Example:**
```markdown
The `pandas.read_csv()` function loads our dataset. We use the `parse_dates` parameter to convert date strings to datetime objects.

Example syntax:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', parse_dates=['date_column'])
```
```

### 4️⃣ Combining Markdown and Code Cells Effectively

Learn when to use Markdown vs code.

You should:

- Use Markdown before code to explain intent
- Use Markdown after code to interpret output
- Avoid placing explanations inside code comments
- Maintain a clean alternation between text and code

**This creates a smooth narrative flow in notebooks.**

**Pattern:**
```
[Markdown] - Explain what you're about to do
[Code] - Execute the operation
[Markdown] - Interpret the results
```

### 5️⃣ Video Walkthrough (~2 Minutes)

Record a short screen-capture video demonstrating Markdown usage.

Your video must include:

- Creating a Markdown cell
- Writing headings and lists
- Adding inline code and code blocks
- Switching between Markdown and code cells
- Brief explanation of why documentation matters

### 📤 Submission Guidelines

- Submit your work as a Pull Request (if required)
- Submit the video link as instructed
- Video should be approximately 2 minutes
- Video must be screen-facing and clearly visible

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- This milestone focuses on **communication, not analysis**
